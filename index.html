                <h2>The Kiwi</h2>
                <p>The Kiwi (Apteryx) is a flightless bird. It has a
                    great meaning for New Zealanders, and you can notice
                    this because the kiwi is the symbol of New Zealand.
                    Māori used to call it as the hidden bird of Tāne, the God
                    of the forest.
                    Kiwis have brown feathers that look like fur, a
                    long bill, and short wings, that make them unable to fly,
                    and small eyes. They tend measure the size of a chicken.</p>
                <p>The biggest kiwi is 45cm tall,
                    while the smallest one is 25cm. They
                    tend to live 50 to 60 years.
                    There are 5 types of kiwis: the
                    North Island brown kiwi, the only of its
                    family that lives at the north wild of the
                    country; Rowi, the rarest one;
                    Southern brown kiwi, the largest one,
                    reaching to 45cm; Little spotted kiwi,
                    the smallest one, reaching to 30 cm; and the Great spotted kiwi, the noisiest.</p>
                <p>Unlike most birds, the Kiwi has a great sense of smell. That feature helps it to
                    easily find food. They are omnivores, meaning that they are able to eat a bit of everything.
                    They usually eat seeds, insects, spiders, worms, berries and some leaves.
                    The kiwi has a huge egg compared to its size, occupying 20% of its body weight.
                    Researchers believe that the reason of the size of its egg is that once kiwis were bigger,
                    but over time, they shrank, while its egg didn’t.</p>
                <p>The main reason for the endangerment of the kiwi is the introduction of nonnative
                    species in New Zealand when the British arrived. After that, kiwis and many species from
                    the country had to deal against the foreigner species, like cats, rats, stoats and ferrets.
                    The number of kiwis decrease 2% every year. Thanks to its meaning to New
                    Zealanders, the kiwi is a priority when it comes animal protection. Nowadays, according
                    to “Save the Kiwi charity”, there are around 68,000 individuals of its kind, and they are
                    doing their best to increase this number.</p>

                <h2>The Tiger</h2>
                <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has
                    a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly
                    vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise
                    only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.

                    Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf
                    and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist
                    broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and
                    preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies
                    home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps
                    with that of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs
                    that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their
                    mother's home range and establish their own.

                    Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and
                    are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and
                    Bali. Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red
                    List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late
                    1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation,
                    poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims
                    of human–wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is
                    scarce. The tiger is legally protected in all range countries. National conservation measures
                    consist of action plans, anti-poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In
                    several range countries, wildlife corridors have been established and tiger reintroduction is
                    planned.

                    The tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in
                    captivity since ancient times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment
                    shows. The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout
                    its historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide.</p>

                <h2>The Penguin</h2>
                <p>Penguins are a group of flightless, semi-aquatic, sea birds which live almost exclusively in the
                    Southern Hemisphere. Only one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives at, and slightly north of, the
                    equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white
                    plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea
                    life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny
                    tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.[4]

                    They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living
                    species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[5] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7
                    in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula
                    minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and weighs
                    1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb).[6] Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller
                    penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were
                    enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human.[7] There was a great diversity of species in
                    subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the
                    equator 35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.</p>
